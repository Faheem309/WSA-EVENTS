<h2>What Is WSA?</h2> 

<br> 

<p>Welcome to the brand new GEMS Winchester School, a modern, spacious and forward thinking international school in the heart of Abu Dhabi, which teaches the British curriculum to children from foundation stage to year 9. 

 

The school, located in Al Danah, Abu Dhabi, has been based on the highly successful Winchester School in Dubai. By combining a highly personalised approach to education with traditional values and innovative ideas, we place special emphasis on the overall development of every student. 

 

We welcome students from around the world, working to develop strong and lasting relationships with parents to deliver the highest possible standard of education. This commitment to both academic and personal excellence is the cornerstone of the GEMS Winchester School. 

 

To reflect the international standing of our school, we teach the National Curriculum for England, a broad and balanced curriculum currently taught in over 150 countries around the world. In years 1 to 9, students progress through the curriculum to develop their skills and competencies. This prepares them for the IGCSE, AS Level and A Level examinations which prepare students for entry into some of the most prestigious colleges and universities around the world.</p>

<h2>What Is Events?</h2> 

<br> 

<p>An event is something that happens, especially when it is unusual or important. You can use events to describe all the things that are happening in a particular situation. Like UAE National Day.</p>
